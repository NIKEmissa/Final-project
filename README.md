# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
In urban planning, it is rather important to determine the traffic volume in each road. In order to control the traffic volume, we need to control the each traffic light’s turning-time to make the most reasonable plan for each traffic light on the road.
Based on the actual situation, we are developing a traffic model to simulate the traffics’ movements in a certain road which contains a few crossroads (traffic lights).  The purpose of this simulation is to examine the average passing time for each car by changing the traffic lights’ turning-time. In the end, not only we will find the shortest passing time for the car but we can make reasonable decision to control the traffic volume as we want.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
We have three variables of uncertainty. 
We consider three traffic lights in a certain road so that each traffic light is an variables because each traffic light has its individuel turning-time.
For each traffic lights we set the range of turning-time is from 35 seconds to 120 seconds which is random distribution.
We think it will be a good representation of reality because the variables and the time range are also selected from reality and also we combine the green light and yellow light to simulate the situation that some people always try to jump a yellow light.
